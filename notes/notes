    SERVICES:
        rosservice list                                                 //lists all services available
        rosservice info /name_of_service                                //gives info about service named /name_of_service
            - Node: node that provides (has created) the service
            - Type: the kind of message used by the topic
            - Args: the arguments that the service takes when called
        rosservice call /the_service_name  TAB-TAB                      //manually call a service. uses double tab completion to show the service message structure
        rossrv show name_of_the_package/Name_of_service                 //explore the structure of that service message

    GAZEBO:
        rostopic echo /gazebo/model_states -n1 //get list of all objects in the gazebo scene

Concepts:
    publisher - node that continouously publishes a message into a topic
    topic - "pipe" for nodes to publish or read info
    service -
        - Request: the part of the service message that defines HOW you will do a call to your service
            - this means what variables you will have to pass to the Service Server so that it is able to complete its task
        - Response: the part of the service message that defines HOW your service will respond after completing its functionality.
            - i.e. if it will return a string with a message indicating success or maybe nothing etc...
        EXAMPLES:
            DeleteModel:
              - Request - contains a string called model_name
              - Response - composed of a boolean named success and a string named status_message


TROUBLESHOOTING:
    python <script_name.py> //runs the python script without ros to see if the code is good
    rosrun <pkg_name> <script_name.py> //makes ros run the python script to check if ROS can do it
